# Data-Driven Analysis of Player Performance

## Overview

This project presents a data-driven analysis of football (soccer) player performance using statistical metrics and exploratory data analysis techniques. The goal is to identify performance trends, compare players across key attributes, and derive insights that can support scouting, team strategy, and player evaluation.

The analysis is written and rendered using **Quarto**, combining narrative explanations with reproducible code and visualizations.

## Objectives

* Analyze player performance using quantitative metrics
* Identify patterns related to age, nationality, and on-field contributions
* Compare consistency and quality of players across different groups
* Translate statistical findings into meaningful football insights

## Data

* **Source:** Kaggle / Football Player Data 
* **Scope:** Soccer Fifa Radings
* **Key variables include:**

  * Player demographics (age, nationality)
  * Performance metrics (ratings, dribbling, passes, weak foot)

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

   * Handling missing values
   * Filtering relevant seasons and players
   * Standardizing variables for comparison

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Distribution of player ratings and performance metrics
   * Group comparisons by age and nationality
   * Variability and consistency analysis

3. **Analysis & Insights**

   * Identification of high-performing player groups
   * Evaluation of consistency across nationalities
   * Interpretation of results in a football performance context

## Key Findings

* Certain nationalities consistently produce higher-rated players
* Player age shows a measurable relationship with performance and consistency
* Performance variability differs significantly across player groups
