    "abstract: _This project examines the key factors that influence a players rating, performance across age groups, variation in player quality, and recommendations on which players to but. The analysis identifies the technical and mental characteristics most strongly correlated with player rating and value, including interception, composure, ball control, and short and long passing. Overall, these findings give insights in how teams can be more effective in recruiting, scouting, and developing players by focusing on attributes depending on a players age range. The only issue is the dataset is outdated meaning some new players are not in the dataset as well as current players rating may not be up to date_.\n",

    "According to Forbes, Manchester United was the team to beat in England for the better part of three decades. However, all of that changed with the departure of the legendary Sir Alex Ferguson. His exit marked the beginning of an unexpected and dramatic decline. Since Ferguson walked away with the club’s last Premier League title, United has only challenged for the league once—and even then, they finished a distant second. Although some silverware has been won, the past few seasons have been underwhelming compared to the Ferguson era. What is most surprising is that the club has continued to increase its revenue while performances on the pitch have been disappointing. Despite higher revenues and a rising valuation, Manchester United has repeatedly failed to qualify for the most lucrative European competition: the Champions League.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put this into perspective, Manchester United was valued at $3 billion when it last won the Champions League, with revenues of $385 million. Even after 12 years of poor performances, the club is now valued at $7 billion and generates around $800 million in revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Ferguson left, there have been eight different managers in the span of twelve years. This level of turnover creates instability and prevents any manager from implementing a long-term system or defining a consistent style of play. Beyond managerial instability, there is also a lack of squad depth. United does not have enough high-quality players on the bench to compete throughout the Premier League season or to consistently qualify for the Champions League. While the starting eleven remains solid, it is no longer exceptional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another major issue is the inconsistency of the players brought into the club, which stems from poor recruitment. Manchester United has spent large transfer fees on players like Antony, Jadon Sancho, Rasmus Højlund, and Mason Mount, relying heavily on them without having adequate backup options. When these players struggle or suffer injuries, there is no equally promising talent available to step in. United needs to focus on recruiting a balanced mix of young players with potential and experienced players who can offer leadership, guidance, and stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis is not only useful for Manchester United but also for any club with significant financial resources that aims to strengthen its squad. This analysis will highlight players and key characteristics for recruiting, looking at different variables such as how different variables affect a player’s rating."

    "Sergio Busquets is the obvious option as he excels compared to all other CDMs. However one thing to keep in mind is his commitment to his current team Barcelona. Sergio Busquets is valued at $51M meaning that is how much he will be going on for the market, however as he has been with Barcelona for his whole career getting him to leave will need a big transfer fee and high wages to even consider him. So I would not recommend to prioritize this transfer.\n",

    "Fernandinho is a true CDM and the second best option. He excels in ball playing and tackles, his progressive play is second to none. In terms of winning duels and being aggressive he is one of the best players for this. The only thing that I am worried about is how much longer will he be able to play at such a high level, he is already 33 so investing into him can possibly give the team 2-3 good years.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would say that the safest option especially for Manchester United is to prioritize Thiago in the transfer window. Thiago is not only still in his prime only being 27 but he is able to play CDM, CM, and CAM. He has more of an attacking mindset but still performs better than most of the CDMs. Thiago would be crucial in progressing the ball from the first third of the field to the second and possibly third part. Now his creativity is second to none and as of now Manchester United need someone who is comfortable with the ball and be able to turn when under pressure, while still delivering great through balls."

    "Dribbling is also a key component whether that is as a defender or as an attacker.

    "Finally ball control, can tell a lot about a players performance and how well they are able handle themselves in tight situations. When getting pressed from an opposition or when controlling a ball from a teammate. This is important as having a player that doesn’t lose the ball and is comfortable in keeping and maintaining the ball is very important.\n",

    "The results of the age-based performance analysis suggest that there are several important recommendations when it comes to recruiting payers, development, and squad planning. First thing is clubs should prioritize players in the 24-29 age range, as this group demonstrated the highest overall rating and the most complete in terms of football profiles. Investing in players at their athletic and technical peak reduces uncertainty and ensures a dependable core within the squad. Meanwhile, Young adults should be viewed as a long term investment, as there is still much risk that can be taken in them. Although these players are not yet in there peak performance, they exhibit strong growth potential, meaning clubs can acquire these players at a relatively low cost and focus on developing these players emphasizing technical skills, tactical awareness, and physical conditioning.\n",

    "This analysis also highlight the importance of managing and maintaining older players at a high level doing it in a strategic way. While senior and veteran players show declines in speed, dribbling, and other physical attributes, they are have strong mental qualities such as composure and positioning. As a result, clubs should change their trainings and match loads to avoid fatigue and injury. Additionally, age specific training programs should be implemented to reflect the differing needs of each group. Younger players would benefit from more intensive technical and tactical development, adults and older adults will require more maintenance to keep there peak level, and older players may benefit from reducing there workload and role in the team."

Countries such as Portugal, Uruguay, and Brazil consistently produce high rated players with high variability in performance, indicating that while these regions produce elite players they also have a wide performance range. Clubs targeting these regions should therefore be prepared for higher risk but also higher potential reward, especially when looking for future stars.\n",

    "Standard deviation proved a valuable indicator of recruitment risk. Nations with lower variability offer greater stability, while nations with higher variability provide greater upside but require more rigorous scouting to differentiate the top talent from the performers who are inconsistent. Additionally many of the countries were underrepresented and many not taken into consideration due to not having many players. Finally, clubs seeking to improve there youth academies should look to the training models of high-performing nations. Being able to emphasize technical development, tactical education, and well structured academy system early on in a players age can help in replicating the consistent player quality seen in top producing countries."
